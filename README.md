# Locating deep space nodes in the solar gravitational lens (SGL)

(work in progress)

- `sgl_lib.py` Library to calculate instantaneous position of the SGL for a given star, time, and heliocentric distance z
- `panlib.py` Get PanSTARRS color image at a sky position
- `example.ipynb` iPython notebook to generate example plots similar to the ones in the paper
- `numbers_in_paper.ipynb` iPython notebook to reproduce the numbers in the paper

## To do
- Make notebook to reproduce exact figures in paper
- Make online tool for people to generate SGL sky charts. People enter network node (e.g., from Alpha Cen A to the sun) plus observation date --> code will produce sky chart of area to be observed
- Documentation
